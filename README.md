# inferno-sidechain
An Ethereum Sidechain using Signed Lava Packets, MerkleProofs, and POWRR

A Signed Lava Packet is simple an offchain signed transaction, designating that X tokens should be transferred to a particular address

POWRR: Proof of Work Round Robin, established by a MiningKing contract which assigns new authoritative kings based on Proof of Work



1. Basic Concepts

  * Consider a lava packet 'mined' if it exists a a leaf inside of a 'mined' merkle root
